        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In this assignment, we implemented various algorithms, including Bezier curve and surface evaluation using de Casteljau's algorithm, computation of area-weighted vertex normals for triangle meshes, and operations such as edge flips and splits on triangle meshes. Additionally, we implemented the loop subdivision algorithm for mesh upsampling. We enhanced our knowledge about the half-edge data structure. Overall, this assignment help us understanding 3D geometry and mesh processing more deeply.

        <b>
            Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
        </b>
        <p>
            De Casteljau's algorithm recursively interpolating between consecutive control points, 
            which would yield a single point lying on the curve for a given parameter \( t \). 
            In the implementation, the `BezierCurve::evaluateStep` function iterates over pairs of 
            consecutive control points, computes the interpolated point using linear interpolation 
            with the parameter \( t \), and stores these points as intermediate control points. 
            This process continues until a single point is obtained.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
        <b>
            Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
        </b>
        <p>
            De Casteljau's algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces by applying an additional 
            separable 1D De Casteljau's algorithm. In this method, each row of control points defines a 
            Bezier curve, and then all the resulting points form another set of control points, which 
            further results in a single point lying on the Bezier surface at the given parameters. 
            In the implementation, the algorithm is adapted to work with a grid of control points. 
            The `evaluateStep` function computes the intermediate points along one dimension of the 
            control points grid, and the `evaluate1D` function fully evaluates one-dimensional de Casteljau's algorithm 
            for a single point. Finally, the `evaluate` function evaluates the Bezier surface at the given 
            parameters by first evaluating the grid of control points along rows and then evaluating the 
            resulting column points along columns.

        <b>
            Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
        </b>
        <p>
            To implement it, we computed the normal vector for each triangle using the cross product of the vectors 
            representing its edges. Then, we multiplied each triangle's normal vector by its area, which is a half 
            of the euclidean length of the normal vector. Finally, we normalized the sum of all the area-weighted 
            vertex normal.

        <p>
            To implement the edge flip, we used diagrams from lecture in order to extract all of the 
            relevant points, faces, and halfedges and assign them to variables so that it would be easier to reassign pointers.
            After making sure that we had all of the necessary components, we used the function setNeighbors() in order to 
            reassign all the halfedge components and make sure that we didn't miss anything.

        <p>
            To implement edge splits, we did a lot of the same operations and procedures as we did for the edge flips 
            since most of the work was just to reassign the different pointers in the HalfEdge data struct. The only difference 
            was that we had to add in a few more objects such as a new point, new edges, half edges, and faces in order to 
            make sure that each half edge pointed to the right thing.

        <p>
            While we didn't have mugh problem with the edge flip, edge split gave us a little bit of trouble
            because of the amount of pointer that had to be reassigned, we were getting errors that 
            said that some vertices did not have positions. We spent a while on it, and then decided 
            it would be best to ask a TA at a homework party, and then we were able to find out that it 
            was because we forgot to assign halfedges to vertices.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
        <b>
            Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
        </b>
        <p>
            To implement Loop Subdivision into the mesh, we have to go through all the vertices and compute their 
            new position using the Loop Subdivision rules outlined in the spec. Additionally, we also have to keep 
            track of whether or not the vertex is part of the new mesh or not in order to know which edges to flip 
            later. After we store the new positions, we split the edges (while also keeping track of which edges are
            new so we only split the edges of the original mesh). Next, we can go through and flip all the edges of 
            the mesh that are connecting an old vertex with a new vertex so that each triangle in the mesh is subdivided
            correctly. Lastly, we can finalize all the vertices and update their positions with the values that we calculated.
        </p>
        <br />


        <b>
            Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after 
            loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? 
            Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges? 
        </b>

        <p>
            One way that the loop subdivision behaves is that it smoothes everything out and, when applied
            enough times, it essentially gets rid of any sharp edges. For example, in teapot.dae shown below,
            you can see the lid is much more angular before the loop subdivision and it gets smoother once 
            the loop subdivision is applied.

            Taking a look at the mesh, since loop subdivision creates additional vertices and edges, it rounds
            out the mesh in order to make it look smoother. However, if we start out with a very simple mesh, 
            such as the cube.dae file shown below, the loop subdivision actually loses the structure of the 
            cube when you apply it multiple times. If there is not enough information in the original mesh, then 
            because we are using the weighted average of neighboring vertex positions, we will start to lose the integrity of the original shape. 
            If we pre-split some edges and then apply upsamplying, we would still lose the sharp corners and edges, as they would essentially be subdivided again during the subdivision process. We can only preserve the sharp corners and edges if we do loop subdivision on certain parts of the object instead of the entire object(i.e, only the smooth surfaces).

        <b>
            Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. 
            Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. 
            Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? 
            Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps 
            alleviate the effects.

            From the screenshots above, you can see that the cube turns asymmetric when it has not been
            pre-subdivided. This is because the loop subdivision is more based off of the current edges, and not 
            the vertices. When the cube is subdivided evenly, the loop subdivision applies more symmetrically and 
            more closely resembles the cube shape.
